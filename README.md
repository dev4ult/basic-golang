# Basic Golang Programming

This repository contains basic syntax like variable, datatype, and control flow (conditional and looping). 

This is just kind of a note for who want to learn golang from the very basic (it only covers the surface). To explore more deep about golang as programming language, you can read the [Full Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/)

## Introduction

Golang is a Programming Language created by google in November 10, 2009. It gains its popularity. Golang is short of Go and Language.

## Online Compiler

Golang has an online compiler, if you want to try golang without need to setup in your local computer, you can go to [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/)

## "Hello World" Program

```main
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
